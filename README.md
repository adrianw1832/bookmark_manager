##Bookmark manager

This project is from the week 4 weekly challenge of the Makers Academy course.
This project introduces the idea of databases and builds on what we have learnt
from week 3 about web architecture. Datamapper is the ORM of choice for this. We
used PostgreSQL for the database. This was also the first exposure to
associations between models.

##Challenges

Database was a new thing for me and it took some time to get used to. I found
reading through the documentation and the menu of datamapper helped a lot.
Playing around in the database console was also helpful. The refactoring process
of doing modular sinatra also proved to be more difficult. Extracting the
controllers and some naming conflicts took a while to solve.

##Technologies used

Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL

RSpec, Capybara


##How to install

Clone the repo, create the databases for development and test environment and
run rackup in the terminal. Visit localhost:9292 to run the bookmark manager.

Run rspec to run the tests.
